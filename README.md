# Digital Signal Processing Package

**This package is collective of a weekly assignments for the digital signal processing course**



### In this package, you will find input and output signals, test functions, GUI, and functions implementation for the following operations:

1- Generating Sinsudial and Cosinsodial signals.

2- A reusable function to read and draw any type of signal.

3- Doing the basic arithmetic operations on the signals like (addition, multiplication, subtracting, and squaring).

4- Calculating the accumulation of a signal.

5- Shifting a signal.

6- Normalizing a signal.

7- Quantizing a signal 

8- Applying discrete Fourier transform(DFT) and Inverse discrete Fourier transform(IDFT).

9- Removing the DC component from a signal in two ways in the time and frequency domain using the Fourier transform.

10- Delying and advancing a signal.

11- Folding a signal.

12- Apply filters on the signal by the moving average and sharpening filter.



13- Applying convolution and correlation.

14- Applying fast convolution and fast correlation.
